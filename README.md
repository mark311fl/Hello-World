# Hello-World

Hi everyone,

My name is Mark. I am a Sitecore content management specialist, and I am new to programming. I have done research on C# and .NET, and have realized that I want to pursue a greater understaning of web development, and I've enrolled in the Harvard CS50 course through edX. I look forward to collaborting on projects in the future.
